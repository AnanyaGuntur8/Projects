                <p>Software focused Undergraduate Freshman in the Rutgers Honors College. Pursing a B.S. Degree in Computer Science and Possible Minor in Data Science-Economic Track. Worked with Java and java OOP, Python and Python OOP (self-learned). Analyzed Machine learning algorithms while simultaneously writing up mentor driven projects. Have experience working with Python Libraries such as Pandas and Matplotlib. Worked with HTML/CSS, JS and React in Frontend Development. Self Learning Machine learning and Neural Networks. 

                    Recognized for Academic Excellence, Leadership, effective collaboration. Recognized for excellence in Innovation with awards such as NASA Techrise winner. Acknowledged for excellent community Service in Science National Honors Society from CBS NY.
                    
                    Involved in FrontEnd Development with Rutgers University Mobile Application Development Club. Hindi and Carnatic Music Teacher. Tutor in Math and Science.
                    
                    Building a FullStack Application that allows students to connect with other study groups and allow them to share notes with each other. This application is designed to help students find a convenient study group that fits in with their busy schedule. Using: Swift, SwiftUI, Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB. Using Xcode and VScode. 
                    
                    Proficient in Telugu, Hindi, English and Some Spanish.

                    <h3>Open Book</h3>
                    <p>Full stack mobile Application that allows users to post anonymous notes without any identifier tied back to the account
                        Collaborated with a team, specifically worked on the machine learning aspect that performs semantic analysis using Jupyter notebooks and Python and outputs an emoji based on the text.
                         Helped integrate the Frontend of the app to the Backend. Integrated Flask to update the backend. </p>

                    <h3>SkInSight</h3>
                    <p>Built a model that detects skin issues with computer vision, based on the data bases. Allowed the user to hold the phone to detect skin deformities. Models can account for different skin colors. Wanted to overcome racial barriers with skin issues. 
                        Used OpenCV and python to build a model that models detection. Achieved an accuracy rate of 70%.  
                        Utilized Google Drive as a connection to the databases. Trained the model based on different tones and pictures to ensure inclusivity.
